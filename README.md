# AI---Assisted-Personalized-Learning-for-Neurodivergent-Students-
This platform dynamically adjusts its teaching style based on studentsâ€™ real-time interactions, ensuring optimal learning for neurodivergent students (ADHD, dyslexia, etc.).
Project Overview

This project is a website designed to personalize learning for neurodivergent students (e.g., ADHD, dyslexia)

using AI. It adjusts text formats, incorporates AI focus techniques, and engages users through gamification.

Final Features to Implement

1. Adaptive Text Formatting (web): 

 - Dyslexia-friendly fonts.

 - Custom line spacing and background color options.

2. AI-Powered Focus Support: 

 - Timed breaks, visual/auditory prompts, attention reminders.

3. Gamification: 

 - Points, badges, and rewards for completing learning modules.

4. Personalization Dashboard: 

 - User profile with learning preferences and analytics.

5. Teacher/Admin Panel: 

 - Overview of student progress and custom settings.

Optional Add-ons (Future Scope)

1. Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text functionality.

2. Interactive chatbot tutor powered by GPT.

3. Multilingual support.

4. Collaborative learning boards (peer-to-peer).

5. Parent Mode for progress monitoring and suggestions.

Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

- Backend: Node.js or Flask (optional for MVP)
  
- AI: GPT API, TensorFlow Lite

- NLP: spaCy, GPT APIs

- Database: Firebase (easy for beginners), or PostgreSQL

Development Phases (Beginner Level)

1. Research: Learn how ADHD/dyslexia affect learning and UI needs.

2. Frontend Setup: Basic website structure (home, login, dashboard).

3. Prototype: Static pages with simulated adaptive text formatting.

4. AI/NLP Integration: Use GPT API for basic chatbot or feedback feature.

5. Gamification Elements: Simple point system using local storage.

6. Final Polish: Add user settings, accessibility testing.
