🧠 Project Overview
Title: NeuroAdapt: A Personalized Learning Platform for Neurodivergent Students

Goal:
To create a dynamic, AI-powered web platform that adapts its interface and learning experience to support neurodivergent students (specifically ADHD and dyslexia). The platform customizes text presentation, offers focus-enhancing tools, and integrates gamification to improve engagement and outcomes.

🎯 Key Features to Implement
1. Adaptive Text Formatting
✅ Dyslexia-friendly fonts (e.g., OpenDyslexic).

✅ Adjustable line spacing, font size, and background color.

✅ Toggle between reading modes (dark mode, distraction-free, etc.).

2. AI-Powered Focus Support
⏱ Timed study/break intervals (Pomodoro-style).

🔔 Visual/auditory reminders for attention checks.

🤖 Optional focus encouragement from GPT-based assistant.

3. Gamification
🏅 Reward system: points for completed modules.

🎯 Unlockable badges and streak counters.

🗂 Leaderboard (optional).

4. Personalization Dashboard
👤 User profile storing preferences (saved via local storage or Firebase).

📈 Analytics on learning sessions, focus, and improvements.

🎨 Custom UI themes based on neurodivergent needs.

5. Teacher/Admin Panel
📊 Overview of student usage and progress.

🎛 Ability to set or suggest custom configurations.

📝 Exportable reports (basic CSV or on-screen dashboard).

🔮 Optional Add-ons (Future Scope)
🗣 Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text

🤖 Interactive GPT Chatbot Tutor

🌍 Multilingual Interface

👥 Collaborative Learning Boards

👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Mode with Progress Reports
